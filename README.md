# One More Line

As the final project for the second year Computer Organization course, myself and [Dasha Moskvitina](https://github.com/dasha-moskv) developed a version of the mobile/desktop game [One More Line](https://store.steampowered.com/app/356890/One_More_Line/), capable of running on the DE1-SoC Computer for the FPGA board of the same name. For a variety of reasons, this code cannot be released publicly. However, if you have any questions about the code, feel free to reach out to either of us.
